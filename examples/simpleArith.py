variable = Word(alphas, exact=1)

# To use the infixNotation helper:
#   1.  Define the "atom" operand term of the grammar.
#       For this simple grammar, the smallest operand is either
#       and integer or a variable.  This will be the first argument
#       to the infixNotation method.
#   2.  Define a list of tuples for each level of operator
#       precendence.  Each tuple is of the form
#       (op_expr, numTerms, rightLeftAssoc, parse_action), where
#       - op_expr is the mo_parsing expression for the operator;
#          may also be a string, which will be converted to a Literal
#       - numTerms is the number of terms for this operator (must
#          be 1 or 2)
#       - rightLeftAssoc is the indicator whether the operator is
#          right or left associative, using the mo_parsing-defined
#          constants RIGHT_ASSOC and LEFT_ASSOC.
#       - parse_action is the parse action to be associated with
#          expressions matching this operator expression (the
#          parse action tuple member may be omitted)
#   3.  Call infixNotation passing the operand expression and
#       the operator precedence list, and save the returned value
#       as the generated mo_parsing expression.  You can then use
#       this expression to parse input strings, or incorporate it
#       into a larger, more complex grammar.
